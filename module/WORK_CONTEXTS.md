# Installed delegated read audience exchange

`ModuleCapabilitiesService.ExchangeDelegatedReadAudience` is an internal,
read-only exchange for a module holding a current signed parent but no owner
bearer. The module authenticates independently with its own module Work Context
and the internal perimeter credential. Its request contains only `binding_id`
and `parent_work_context_token`. No owner, actor, target audience or scope is
caller selectable. The parent must address the authenticated module's installed
prefix and tenant; the canonical current-revision and every-hop revocation
checks run before exchange and again before returning the child. Delegated
parents require a configured durable journal. Actor ceilings and scope
attenuation use the same signer and authority path as owner audience exchange.

Installation declares an optional `read_audiences` map in the existing
`module-capabilities/MODULE_PRINCIPALS` registry, for example:

```json
{"example":{"tenant":"019f6bf7-5b4b-74e5-8c17-092259bb1661","read_audiences":{"proof":{"audience":"example-producer","scopes":[{"resource_kind":"results"}]}}}}
```

Each installed scope may additionally restrict `resource_ids`. Actions are
always exactly `read`. The incoming parent must already admit all installed
scopes; installation never confers new viewer authority. A child lives at most
60 seconds and less than the remaining parent lifetime. Owner, tenant, Task,
Session and actor/delegation chain remain unchanged. The response is secret and
must not be logged. No persisted credential or broad signing port is created. Interactive calls can continue using the existing owner-bearer
`WorkContextService.ExchangeAudience` API.
