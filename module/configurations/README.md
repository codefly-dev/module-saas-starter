# Host configuration groups

Each environment declares values in `<group>.env` and secrets in
`<group>.secret.env`. Codefly delivers these to services declaring the group;
consuming workspaces override a group rather than editing module-owned files.

## datasource-oauth

Accounts reads three JSON maps, all keyed by connector:

| Key | Delivery | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `providers` | value | `authorize_url`, `token_url`, and `scopes` for each provider |
| `client_id` | value | The deployment's registered client identifier |
| `client_secret` | secret | The confidential client secret; omit for public clients |

The local provider and client-id maps are empty, which disables generic sign-in.
The secret map contains only a local placeholder for `api`. For example,
`providers={"api":{"authorize_url":"https://auth.example.com/authorize","token_url":"https://auth.example.com/token","scopes":["read","offline_access"]}}`
and `client_id={"api":"example-client"}` configure the public metadata. The
operator supplies the matching secret map through Codefly's secret provider.
Both endpoints must use HTTPS. Register the host callback URI with the provider.

The app registration is deployment-wide. Per-organization provider app
registrations are outside this version. The source's refresh token, cached
access token, and confidential client secret use the existing `datasourceCipher`
envelope; this group adds no credential store. The PKCE verifier stays server-side
and state is bound to organization, person, connector, source, and callback.
